<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appbrewery/webdev/main/birthday-cake3.4.jpeg">
<p>On the 2nd of May, 2025, I'll be turning 29. I've not done much with my life and something recently happened to someone I used to love. Apparently she's getting married... If only I had made better decisions with my life</p>
<p>Decisions like:</p>
<ul>  
    <li>Pursuing a better career</li>
    <li>Being more proactive and showing more initiative towards career pivots</li>
    <li>Just being better</li>
</ul>
